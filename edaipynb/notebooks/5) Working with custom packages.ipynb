    "Note that the project name appears twice here. The higher level is the project and the lower level contains the actual source code. I also already included `setup.py`, which will be used later to distribute the package. The `__init__.py` file indicates that the folder `edaipynb` is actually a python package and not just a simple folder. At this stage `__init__.py` is just an empty text file.\n",

    "- In PyCharm go to `File->New project`, change untitled for the project name (e.g. edaipynb) and select the python interpreter. You can either setup a custom virtual environment or select the standard interpreter. Let's do the latter for now.\n",
    "- Add a new python package with the same name as your project (this automatically creates the `__init__.py` in the new subfolder).\n",
    "- Add the `setup.py` file for example by copying and modifying the file from https://github.com/JanGieseler/edaipynb/setup.py.\n",
    "- add the version number to `edaipynb/__init__.py` by `__version__ = '0.1a0'`\n",
    "- add a `readme.md` and add some [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) text \n",
    "\n",
    "Your file structure should now looks something like:\n",
    " ```\n",
    "edaipynb/\n",
    "    edaipynb/\n",

    "\n",
    "Tip: The `edaipynb` follows the above structure, so that you can just use it as a template. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
